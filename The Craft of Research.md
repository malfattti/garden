## Chapter 3: From Topics to Questions
### Subject: 
- a broad area of knowledge
### Topic: 
- specific interest within an area. 
- specific approach to a subject:
	- asking a question, the answer of which would solve a problem that my readers care about
- How to pick a topic:
	- start with what most interests you
	- you do not have to be an expert on it, you do want to become one
	- make a list of interests that you would like to explore
	- choose one or two by:
		- skimming the subheadings of your topic in general guides/reference books/specialized indexes
		- look for online/paper encyclopedias or other reputed online references and check out the bibliography at the end of the entry for your general topic
		- find ideas in blogs
		- find what interests other researchers
		- skim latest issues of journals in your field (not just articles but conference announcements, calls for papers, reviews)
		- investigate which resources are particularly abundant in your library.
- How to go from a broad topic to a focused topic
	- a topic: a starting point for your research (*topos*) from which you can head off in a particular direction and narrow it down from broad to focused
		- a topic is too broad if you can state it in four or five words: "Free will in Tolstoy"
	- a topic must be narrowed down by adding words and phrases, specially those deriving from "action" words: "The **conflict** of free will and inevitability in Tolstoy's **description** of three battles in *War and Peace*
		- lacking these action words make your topic a static claim, and  these do not lead anywhere: "There is free will in Tolstoy's novels". 
		- adding the "action" words transform these claims into something a reader could be interested in: "The **conflict** of free will and inevitability in Tolstoy's **description** of three battles in *War and Peace* --> In *War and Peace* Tolstoy describes three battles
