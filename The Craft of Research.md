## Chapter 3: From Topics to Questions
### Subject: 
- a broad area of knowledge
### Topic: 
- specific interest within an area. 
- specific approach to a subject:
	- asking a question, the answer of which would solve a problem that my readers care about
- How to pick a topic:
	- start with what most interests you
	- you do not have to be an expert on it, you do want to become one
	- make a list of interests that you would like to explore
	- choose one or two by:
		- skimming the subheadings of your topic in general guides/reference books/specialized indexes
		- look for online/paper encyclopedias or other reputed online references and check out the bibliography at the end of the entry for your general topic
		- find ideas in blogs
		- find what interests other researchers
		- skim latest issues of journals in your field (not just articles but conference announcements, calls for papers, reviews)
