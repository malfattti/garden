- Decadent Love: Deviant Courtship in two Decadent Short Stories

In this paper I will explore the theme of courtship, understood in a broad sense, in Mabel Wotton's The Fifth Edition and Robert W. Chambers' The Street of our Lady of the Fields. In The Fifth Edition, although Franklyn Leyden's pursuit of the Miss Suttaby resembles a courtship in terms of his performance, his reward is not her affection, but her work and ideas. Furthermore, if realized, their romantic relationship would be considered "deviant" because of her being older. In The Street of our Lady of the Fields, Hasting does earnestly court Valentine. However, it is strongly suggested in the story that Valentine is a prostitute and that she does not wish him to know (although their friends in common know about it, and keep it secret).

The eye is essential in courtship, and the fact that these are out of the ordinary courtships does not change that. This is why I will focus on the narrative's construction of a problematized relationship between characters' self-presentation and its reception by other characters. 

characters' self-presentation and how they are received, and how the narrator perceives and presents that aspect of the story. With this analysis I aim to answer the following questions: how are these deviant courtships presented and to what aim? How is this presentation related to the decadent agenda?




therefore, what the characters show of themselves does not always correspond to reality. Leyden's performance shows him as a good young man, while the thoughts and actions that we learn from him do not match this ideal. Valentine actively avoids telling Hastings the truth, although she knows he believes her to be someone different. Moreover, what the characters show of themselves is not always interpreted correcty by the others. Miss Wotton 

is an unconventional courtship in the sense that, while his performance resembles that of a conventional courtship, what he wishes to obtain is different 



he does not wish to earn her affection with his performance, but her ideas and work. His performance

- Dissident passions? And why?

- Elements which are important in these relationships:
	- clothes, manners, self-presentation (descriptions) - how one looks
	- feelings and ideas about the other one (and how these are conveyed) - how the others are looking
	- why are these relationships somehow dissident?
	- why does romance never fully work in decadence?

- courtship:
	-  broadening the sense of what courthsip means
	-  extend and stretch the term 
	-  courtship in terms of seeing each other, imposing their own ideas onto others, and the others receiving them: showing oneself and being received. How do those match?
	- a problematized relationship: what is seen is not what is projected, what is being projected is not what is seen
	- how are they being problematized?
 
- The fifth edition: 
	- marginalized character, starting from complete exclusion
	- use the fifth edition to establish the problems
	- giving and receiving of who one is cannot happen. she doesnt give much away either
	- decadence aesthetic: he doesnt have a way of describing her in the world that he lives in 
	-  look at it on a textual level:
	  - fifth edition: weird focalization thing: he is so unable to see her that the narrative itself is not being able to see her. we also cannot see her properly. however he is not the narrator. he overwhelms the narrator. his effect on her is so strong

- The Street of our Lady of the Fields
	- a little more subtle and nuances
	- he also doesn't see her but it is not the same thing exactly
	- this courtship ritual 
	- chambers: very close reading section. really close reading and picking apart.

  - In general:
	  - mediating characters and filtering characters.
	  - look at it on a textual level:
		  - fifth edition: weird focalization thing: he is so unable to see her that the narrative itself is not being able to see her. we also cannot see her properly. however he is not the narrator. he overwhelms the narrator. his effect on her is so strong
		  - the best version of this essay accounts on the narrative and the reader into the courship ritual as well. what role does it/do they play?
		  - what is the text seeing and offering? (courtship between reader and text: what is the text offering the reader)
	  - the same relationship is happening between the character and the text?
	  - focus on courtship and the fifth edition
	  - Our Lady is so based in the decadent community
	  - the fifth edition is not decadet figures directly
	  - in the transition take account of the difference. acknowledge these are characters that belong to a very different environment. Hastings: he is a liminal character, he is not fully one of them either
	  - situation of Chamber's text: tick the decadent box 
	  - fifth edition: fin de siecle character (artistic and intelectual freedom).
		  - belongs to decadence but he is not a decadent figure. he benefits from the decadent movement. enjoying the intelectual freedom without being a Dorian Gray character
		  - nice segue into the other male character
		  - demonstrated that being able to situate text
		  - key themes that run through
		  - if argument is that it is a neglected text, then give it its importance with a detailed, close reading analysis

  - come back to her with outline and send it to her 
  - do it in june
