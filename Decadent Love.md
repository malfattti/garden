	- Decadent Love: Courtship and Romance in Three Decadent Short Stories
- Three or four short stories:
	- The Street of our Lady of the Fields (Chambers)
	- The Yellow Sign (Chambers)
	- The Fifth Edition (Wotton)
	- Theodora: A Fragment? (Cross)

- Dissident passions? And why?

- Elements which are important in these relationships:
	- clothes, manners, self-presentation (descriptions) - how one looks
	- feelings and ideas about the other one (and how these are conveyed) - how the others are looking
	- why are these relationships somehow dissident?
	- why does romance never fully work in decadence?

Meeting with Zöe

- courtship:
	-  broadening the sense of what courthsip means
	-  extend and stretch the term 
	-  courtship in terms of seeing each other, imposing their own ideas onto others, and the others receiving them: showing oneself and being received. How do those match?
	- a problematized relationship: what is seen is not what is projected, what is being projected is not what is seen
	- how are they being problematized?
 
- The fifth edition: 
	- marginalized characters - from complete exclusion

  

use the fifth edition to establish the problemas

giving and receiving of who one is cannot happen. she doesnt give much away either

  

decadence aesthetic: he doesnt have a way of describing her in the world that he lives in 

while in chambers he 

  

a little more subtle and nuances

he also doesnt see her but it is not the same thing exactky

  

this courtship ritual 

  

mediating characters and filtering characters.

look at it on a textual level:

fifth edition: weird focalization thing: he is so unable to see her that the narrative itself is not being able to see her. we also cannot see her properly. however he is not the narrator. he overwhelms the narrator. his effect on her 

  

the best version of this essay accounts on 

the narrative and the reader into the courship ritual asss well

  

what is the text seeing and offering?

the same relationship is happening between the character and the text

  

chambers: very close reading section. really close reading and picking apart.

  

focus on courtship and the fifth edition

  

our lady is so based in the decadent community that 

the fifth edition is not decadet figures directly

in the transition take account of the differende. acknowledge these are characters that belogn to a very different environment.he is a liminal character, he is not fully one of them either

situation of chamber's text

tick the decadent box 

  

fifth edition fin de siecle characyer (artictis and intelectual freedom). it belogns to the decadent movement who woth in their own way are decadents. 

  
  

belong sto decadence but he is not a decadent figure. he benefits from the decadent movement. enjoying the intelectual freedom without being a dorian gray character

  

nice segway into the other male characyer

  
  

demonstrated that being able to situate text

key themes that run through

if argument is that it is a neglected text 

  
  

come back to her with outline and send it to her 

  

try to do it in june
