	- Decadent Love: Courtship and Romance in Three Decadent Short Stories
- Three or four short stories:
	- The Street of our Lady of the Fields (Chambers)
	- The Yellow Sign (Chambers)
	- The Fifth Edition (Wotton)
	- Theodora: A Fragment? (Cross)

- Dissident passions? And why?

- Elements which are important in these relationships:
	- clothes, manners, self-presentation (descriptions) - how one looks
	- feelings and ideas about the other one (and how these are conveyed) - how the others are looking
	- why are these relationships somehow dissident?
	- why does romance never fully work in decadence?

COURTSHIP BROADENING THE SENSE OF WHAT COURTHSIP MEANS

EXTEDE AND STRETCH THE TERM 

COURTSHIP IN TERMS OF SEEING EACH OTHER, IMPOSING THEIR OWN IDEAS ONTO OTHER S AND RECEIVING THEM

THIS COURTSHIP RITUAL 

MEDIATING CHARACTERS AND FILTERING CHARACTERS.
LOOK AT IT ON A TEXTUAL LEVEL:
FIFTH EDITION: WEIRD FOCALIZATION THING: HE IS SO UNABLE TO SEE HER THAT THE NARRATIVE ITSELF IS NOT BEING ABLE TO SEE HER. WE ALSO CANNOT SEE HER PROPERLY. HOWEVER HE IS NOT THE NARRATOR. HE OVERWHELMS THE NARRATOR. HIS EFFECT ON HER 

THE BEST VERSION OF THIS ESSAY ACCOUNTS ON 
THE NARRATIVE AND THE READER INTO THE COURSHIP RITUAL ASSS WELL

WHAT IS THE TEXT SEEING AND OFFERING?
THE SAME RELATIONSHIP IS HAPPENING BETWEEN THE CHARACTER AND THE TEXT

CHAMBERS: VERY CLOSE READING SECTION. REALLY CLOSE READING AND PICKING APART.
