- **Introduction**
	- This paper focuses on the relationship between transnationalism in globalization and the concept of the nation-state withing language and migration studies.
	- Are the former undermining the latter? Or do the essentialist ties between language and national identities continue to be an important model in the context of transnationalism
	- it is necessary to understand the relationships between the ideologies and material conditions.
- **Overview**
	- **Language and the nation-state**
		- since the 18th century: people's identity and worldview has been guided by the notion of a state with jurisdiction over a particular territory and its citizens 
			- citizens of the emerging sovereign states saw themselves as equal in many respects
		- nation state -->nationalism
		- Language played an important role in the creation of nation-states 
			- the group of citizens inhabiting the boundaries of a state were supposed to speak a single language
			- language was carrier of the culture
			- However, the relationship between territory, ethnicity and language that function as the basis of the nation-state is a constructed and idealized one:
				- the nation-state is presented as clearly bounded and internally homogeneous
				- these ideologies justify and naturalize the existence of the nation-state
				- these ideologies must be presennted as natural and timeless through erasing everything that doesn't fit (such as other ethnic groups, other languages)
			- nationalism needs to downplay difference and over-emphasize the shared
