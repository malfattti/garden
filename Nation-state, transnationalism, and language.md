- **Introduction**
	- This paper focuses on the relationship between transnationalism in globalization and the concept of the nation-state withing language and migration studies.
	- Are the former undermining the latter? Or do the essentialist ties between language and national identities continue to be an important model in the context of transnationalism
	- it is necessary to understand the relationships between the ideologies and material conditions.
- **Overview**
	- **Language and the nation-state**
		- since the 18th century: people's identity and worldview has been guided by the notion of a state with jurisdiction over a particular territory and its citizens 
			- citizens of the emerging sovereign states saw themselves as equal in many respects
		- nation state -->nationalism
		- Language played an important role in the creation of nation-states 
			- the group of citizens inhabiting the boundaries of a state were supposed to speak a single language
			- language was carrier of the culture
			- However, the relationship between territory, ethnicity and language that function as the basis of the nation-state is a constructed and idealized one:
				- the nation-state is presented as clearly bounded and internally homogeneous
				- these ideologies justify and naturalize the existence of the nation-state
				- these ideologies must be presennted as natural and timeless through erasing everything that doesn't fit (such as other ethnic groups, other languages)
			- nationalism needs to downplay difference and over-emphasize the shared features of its members
			- nationalism is not a stable feature, it must be maintaines
				- promotion of a national language is one of the social mechanisms used to maintain nationalism

	- **Transnationalism and the challenges to the nation-state**
		- the work implied in sustaining the nation-state and nationalism becomes harder in the context of globalization, because the role of nation-states and links between nations and states are problematized/diminished in the new economic dynamics, for example
		- the phenomenon of transnationalism implies even greater complications 
			- because transnationalism ecompasses relationships across national borders, it is not just relevant fro migrants, but also for those who are not on the move
			- it problematizes the essentialist links between territory, language and national identity that sustain the idea of nation-state
			- multiple belongings and flexible sense of moorings
			- a shared identity among people may be no longer be strongly attached to a physical territory 
			- while the state is still important as an institutional arrangement, it may no longer be as important to determine someone's identity
			- 'flexible citizenship': as opposed to a more traditional sense of citizenship, a choice of citizenship is no longer influenced by a sense of loyalty or identification with the community, but by whatever is more convenient economically
			- of course, such flexibility is only afforded to an elite (citizenship is still granted by a state)
			- states also employ economic criteria when selecting potential new citizens
			- states may continue to be relevant, nation-states less so
			- bc language is so central to the idea of nation-state, what is the role of language in this context? are the ties between language and national identity being weakened or is an essentialist view of language still relevant to the shaping of identities?
- **Issues and ongoing debates** 
	- the opposing views regarding language and nation state in the context of transnationalism show the complexity between these terms
		- multiple ideologies of language

	- Transidiomaticity (Jacquemet): 
		- recombination, mix or hybridization of linguistic resources
		- intersection between moving people and moving texts through new technologies
		- use of newly acquired techno-linguistic skills
		- in doing so people increase their social worth (power)
	- However, individuals are still physically located somewhere (as Blommaert and Maryns argue)
		- this mitigates claims about deterritorialization
		- 	this process has been met with tendencies towards hegemonization and centering of language and linguistic practices
				- emphasis on purity and ownership
		- it also means there will always be localized constraints that they need to negotiate
		- any discussion about power needs to be qualified
		- assylum seekers have been deterritorialized, but their narratives and language practices in the host societies are attemtps at reterritorializing
		- nation state's relevance: migrants' use of language is judged against the hegemonic positioning of the local national language, which leads to social discrimination based on the idea that the migrant's version of language lacks legitimacy 
		- example: Rinkeby Swedish, the variety of Swedish spoken by migrants in the Rinkeby neighborhood as judged by the native Swedish population
			- this label applies to the Swedish spoken by a hetergoenous community of migrants
			- both native Swedes and immigrants themselves consider this variety to be inauthentic Swedish
			- nation state's relevance:  migrants struggle to find legitimacy for their language use from the host society, which uses the nation-state as a reference point for community
			- the opposite can also happen: example of French-Canadian school struggling to maintain its commitment to heritage while also accommodating new students who find value in Parisian French and English as more "global" languages
	- Thus, ideologies of essentialist connection between language and national identity are juxtaposed with ideologies that view this connection as flexible
	- this contestation takes place in the context of an increased reflexivity and awareness of life elsewhere brought about by globalization 
- **Implications of this complexity**
	- **Language and citizenship**
		- migration leads to liguistic diversity and thus to different valuations of the codes and varieties
		- if left unchecked these can lead to discrimination, segregation, etc
		- therefore language policy decisions need to interfere in this process so that national unity can be maintained while at the same time respecting diversity
