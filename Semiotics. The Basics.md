## Dennotation and connotation
- the two parts of meaning
- Dennotation: informational function
	- definitional, literal, obvious meaning of a sign
- Connotation: aesthetic function
	- more polysemic aspect of signs
	- secondary overtones that may be read into any sign, regardless of connotation
- there is no denotation without connotation
- Connotation requires knowledge of social context
- they require interpretation and thus challenge the notion of communication as decoding
