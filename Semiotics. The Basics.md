## Dennotation and connotation
- the two parts of meaning
- Dennotation: informational function
	- definitional, literal, obvious meaning of a sign
- Connotation: aesthetic function
	- more polysemic aspect of signs
	- secondary overtones that may be read into any sign, regardless of connotation
- there is no denotation without connotation
- Connotation requires knowledge of social context
- they require interpretation and thus challenge the notion of communication as decoding
- Barthes states that connotation creates the illusion of denotation, denotation os just another connotation
- Dennotation can rather be see as a naturalization process
- Althusser states that together with dennotation we also learn dominant connotations, which position us within ideology
	- connotations tend to support cultural stereotypes
	- connotational frameworks are organized around key positions and equations within cultural codes, each pole aligned with a cluster of symbolic attributes
- connotation and dennotation are not easily or neatly separated
	- there is no depiction or description without an evaluative element
- there is no literal meaning, denotation simply has a broader consensus
- connotation is looser, less conventional
	- some connotations are diely recognized unconsciously
