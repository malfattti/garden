## Dennotation and connotation
- the two parts of meaning
- Dennotation: informational function
	- definitional, literal, obvious meaning of a sign
- Connotation: aesthetic function
	- more polysemic aspect of signs
	- secondary overtones that may be read into any sign, regardless of connotation
- there is no denotation without connotation
- Connotation requires knowledge of social context
- they require interpretation and thus challenge the notion of communication as decoding
- Barthes states that connotation creates the illusion of denotation, denotation os just another connotation
- Dennotation can rather be see as a naturalization process
- Althusser states that together with dennotation we also learn dominant connotations, which position us within ideology
	- connotations tend to support cultural stereotypes
	- connotational frameworks are organized around key positions and equations within cultural codes, each pole aligned with a cluster of symbolic attributes
- connotation and dennotation are not easily or neatly separated
	- there is no depiction or description without an evaluative element
- there is no literal meaning, denotation simply has a broader consensus
- connotation is looser, less conventional
	- some connotations are widely recognized unconsciously 
- Barthes created a stratified model of connotation
	- dennotation is the first order of signification
	- connotation is the second: the denotative sign becomes the signifier of a connotative sign
	- idea that dennotation is a primary meaning has been challenged by other theorists
	- Language is not neutral and transparent
		- outr paradigmatic choices generate connotations
	- Connotation is not purely paradigmatic, sytagmatic relations are also relevant. The way connotations are perceived depends on the context
-  connotations depend more on social intersubjectivity than on individual subjectivity
-  they are dynamic and subject to change 
-  connotational codes: pervasive patterns of connotations
-  connotation is very important in the advertising discourse

## Myth
- Cultural myths help us make sense of our experiences within a culture
	- they express and organize shared ways of conceptualizing phenomena within a culture
	- they draw upon a 'cultural vocabulary'
- they account for contradictions within cultures
	- brand myth: a brand offers a solution to a contradiction 
- Like connotation, myths belong to a higher order of signification, according to Barthes
- the dennotative sign also becomes the signifier of the connotative sign
	- in the case of myth, modes of representation which myth uses to build its own system become the signifier of mythical metalanguage.
