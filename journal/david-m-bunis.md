## [[Modernization and the Language Question among Judezmo-Speaking Sephardim of the Ottoman Empire]]
### Introduction
- Origins:
  - In Medieval Spain from the interaction of Jews with Spanish and Arabic-speaking neighbors
  - mix of elements from Old Castilian, Hebrew-Aramaic, Judeo-Arabic and Judeo-Greek.
  - unique use of material incorporated from non-native sources
- 1492: expulsion of the Jews from Spain:
  - transplanted to Ottoman Empire and North Africa
  - survived there until modern times
- 19th century: 
  - modifications through:
    - internal trends
    - contacts with new neighbors: Turks, Greeks, Slavs in the Ottoman Empire / Arabs, Berbers, Spaniards and French in North Africa
   - More presence of Western European nations in the Ottoman Empire
     - western influence in the cultures of the empire.
     - young Sephardim react judging their own community and culture as retrograde
       - desire to change in direction of the modern West: modernization, Westernization and secularization
  
### The Language Problem and the Solutions Proposed
- Consequences of Western influence:
  - the so far course of development of Judezmo was interrupted:
    - so far natural and locally oriented phenomenon
  - deep effects of Western influence in Judezmo speakers' attitudes towards their language.
- 1880s, *El tyempo periodical*. Its editor David Fresco berated Judezmo and its speakers and announced the death of the language. This article set off a debate around "the language question" which mainly took place in the Judezmo press for over a century.
- Key questions:
  - is judezmo a language ir a dialect of Spanish? 
  - What name should be used for it?
  - should it be maintained and in what form? traditional and popular variety or a new one? what model should the modification follow? alphabet?
  - should it be abandoned? and how should it be replaced?
- Outsiders such as Angel Pulido also noted this debate and took part in it.

###Delineated solutions
- Abandonment and replacement
- Argument: Judezmo is a corrupted dialect of Spanish, no intrinsic cultural value and has no role in the modern world. It only serves as barrier between Jews and other ethnic groups. It should then be replaced by one of the following:
  - A Western European International Language:
    - a prestigious and commercially useful language.
    - at least Judezmo speakers should learn Western languages even if they do not replace Judezmo.
    - initially this proposal was rejected but soon Sephardi children were increasingly educated in European languages, culture and literatures at school. 
    - Four specially important languages: Spanish, French, Italian, German.
  - Spanish: Influence started when mid XIX century Protestant missionaries tried to convert the sephardim and created educational material written in a language between Modern Spanish and Judezmo. The conversion failed but the materials continued to circulate.
