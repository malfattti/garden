1925 (Versailles)-1998

## General information
- Lyotard was at the center of the debates about portmodernism that took place in 1980s and 1990
- he announced the end of grand narratives
- labeled "a young conservative" by [[Jürgen Habermas]]
  - postmodernists argued that a general human emancipation could not be achieved with the tools of liberalism, nor with those of communism.
    - he was a leftist activist in his youth but was disappointed by the French Communist Party for its inability to respond to the crises of the French colonial war in Algeria and the student revolution of 1968.
    - Marxism seem to be unable to support any social movement that did not emerge from the working class or was related to economic problems.
    - he turned first to Psychoanalysis and then to Philosophy and tried to find new bases that were nor Marxist nor Liberalist, for aesthetic, political and moral judgment and action.

## Defining the Postmodern (1986)
- His aim is to open the debate on postmodernism. 
- He presents three debates around post-modernism
  - the opposition between modernism and post-modernism:
    - Modernist art aimed to revolutionize society, but these dreams were proved unachievable by other means than violence, and even then they prove unsuccesful.
        - Post-modernist architecture, for example, has given up the dream of rebuilding the whole space inhabited by humanity, and is sentenced to make only small modifications in the spaces it inherited.
  - connotation around the word:
    - decay in confidence placed in progress
    - Neither liberalism nor Marxism are free from "suspicion of crimes against mankind"
    - mankind seems to be moving towards complexification. Not "progress" in a same direction, but development in different ones
      - division of mankind in two parts: complexification and survival
  - Post-modernist art is connected to the psychoanalytic technique of anamnesis
  - the artist incorporates elements from past traditions in order to work through them, to avoid Modernism's mistake of trying to break from the past, resulting in repeating it altogether.

## Universal versus diverse approach / progress versus movements
  - one universal standard generates hostility to the different.
- Postmodernism responds to the idea of progress as a universal march towards the same utopian future with a respect for diversity an local differences and for plurality of ways of living.
- local difference, or "language games" following Wittgenstein, is incommensurate
- they propose to stop trying to fit everyone into one mold and to make history move in one direction only.
- views on progress:    
  - at times, recognizes it is a good thing
  - at times, affirms that we are already postmodern and distrustful of grand narratives of modernization and improvement of all
  
  ## Objections:
  These show that we do not have such position yet  
    - Habermas condemns Lyotard's position as unable to judge different ways of life passive. It would lead us to accept everything, as it is.
    - the lack of standards makes us unable to dream of a future better than the present
    - Lyotard's counterargument would be that preventing someone from living their chosen way of life would be a crime in his model, and thus atrocities such as Hitler's rise to power and the Holocaust should be halted in it.
  ## More views on literature and art
    Focus: style and expression shifts between modernism and postmodernism.
    -  In postmodernist art: signs of traumatic stress disorder 
    -  manifested in pastiche. Modernism aimed at breaking with the past, but in consequence ends up repeating it. Post-modernism is trying to shake Modernism, and does so by working through past material, the tradition, in order to overcome it.
    -  He says that the fragmentation of the self that we are experiencing is a healthy moment, because we are trying to consider all the incommensurate pieces of our world, but we cannot expect a neat result.
    -  complexity cannot be sidestepped, and art should aim to make us reflect on it.
    -  he later links postmodernist art with the sublime.
    -  He states that art is one of the few instances were what cannot be captured by any existing signifying system can make its existence felt.
    -  to avoid using modernist's categorical reduction and simplification of terms, we must cultivate an appreciation for the sublime, of what resist calculation and understanding.
    -  if postmodernism art can capture this, then we can dream of a future generation which would not condemn differences and allows them to thrive. such a future would do justice to the complexity we live in.

## The Postmodern Condition
A report on the state of knowledge in post- modernity.
- Aim of study: the postmodern condition:
    the condition of knowledge in the most-highly developed societies
- the state of our culture after the transformations which have changed the game rules for science, literature and the arts
- the author proposes to place the transformations in the context of the crises of narratives.
  - science and narratives have always been at conflict but science also has a discourse to legitimize itself, philosophy:
    - in modern science, this discourse appeals to some grand narrative: the dialectics of spirit, the hermeneutics of meaning, the emancipation of the rational or working subject or the creation of wealth
    - grand narratives are built around trascendental signifieds (as per Derrida)
    - they hierarchically arrange the local narratives they comprise 
    - they have lost legitimation. The trascendental signifieds they are built around have proven to be volatile, are never and can never be really present.
 - postmodern is the position of incredulity towards grand narratives
      - originated by progress in science itself, but the progress itself presupposes it
      - manifested in the crisis of metaphysical philosophy
      - product of the proliferation of techniques and techonologies sicde WWII, which has shifted emphasis from actions to its means, also the advance of capitalism and its emphasis on individuality however,m the seeds of delegitimation are already in the discourse of the nineteenth century
      - power legitimates science and the law on the basis of their efficiency, and legitimates this efficiency on the basis of science and law.
      - -knowledges are being created for the purposes of power
      - this last remaining master narrative of performance:
        - input > output? > should optimize the whole system
        - form of terror: it only works if you are commensurable (local narratives are commensurable to the system) or they are just considered as obstacles and thus dissappear
        - exclusion of certain language games because they cannot be made compatible with the assumptions of the master narrative of performance
- what remains are the small narratives they comprise, none of which can claim more validity or dominance over the others
   - postmodernism assumes that nothing can be completely new (while Modernism claimed to establish a narrative about newness cutting ties from anything that came before), history is an archive to be quoted, a toolbox. Cannot be discarded as Modernism proposed.
     - engineer versus bricoleur
- As there are no more legitimate master narratives, human coexistance is thus a play of incommensurable language games, none of them can claim to be the only legitimate one.
  - all the different discourses cannot be made to match the underlying assumption of the master discourse, this would do them injustice
  - if languages are incommensurable how can be ensure they are not forced into this mould or excluded
  - ensure that everyone is able to play the language game that they like
  - try to make interesting moves on the language board
    - invent new and more exciting moves
    - 
- 
    - the narrative function is being dispersed in clouds of narrative language elements, we like at the intersection of many of these
      - the subject is constituted by the elements that cross it.
      - the subject is the nodal point within the networks of discourses
      - the subjects can chose how to go about: realigning, reinventing new connections, not creating an entirely new discourse
 - postmodern knowledge: paralogy
   - is legitimation possible?
       - consensus does violence to the violence of the heterogeneity of language games. consensus can only be reached when we assume that certain forms of discourse are commensurable
       - 
   - what characterizes the new form of postmodern knowledge
   - -emphasis not on consensus but on dissensus. 
   - invention and new moves can only exist where there is discent.
   - no invention can exist without the other. 
   - the only thing tan counts is the paralogy of inventing:
   - taking what is known and finding new combinations for it
   - the rules are set, we cannot invent a new game but we can move the figures on the board in surprising or interesting manners

  - The future: pragmatics of language particles
