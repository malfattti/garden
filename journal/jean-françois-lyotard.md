1925 (Versailles)-1998

## General information
- Lyotard was at the center of the debates about portmodernism that took place in 1980s and 1990
- he announced the end of grand narratives
- labeled "a young conservative" by [[Jürgen Habermas]]
  - postmodernists argued that a general human emancipation could not be achieved with the tools of liberalism, nor with those of communism.
    - he was a leftist activist in his youth but was disappointed by the French Communist Party for its inability to respond to the crises of the French colonial war in Algeria and the student revolution of 1968.
    - Marxism seem to be unable to support any social movement that did not emerge from the working class or was related to economic problems.
    - he turned first to Psychoanalysis and then to Philosophy and tried to find new bases that were nor Marxist nor Liberalist, for aesthetic, political and moral judgment and action.

## Defining the Postmodern (1986)
- Modernist art aimed to revolutionize society, but these dreams were proved unachievable by other means than violence, and even then they prove unsuccesful.
  - one universal standard generates hostility to the different.
- Postmodernism responds to the idea of progress as a universal march towards the same utopian future with a respect for diversity an local differences and for plurality of ways of living.
- local difference, or "language games" following Wittgenstein, is incommensurate
- they propose to stop trying to fit everyone into one mold and to make history move in one direction only.
- views on progress:    
  - at times, recognizes it is a good thing
  - at times, affirms that we are already postmodern and distrustful of grand narratives of modernization and improvement of all
  
  ### Objections:
  These show that we do not have such position yet  
    - Habermas condemns Lyotard's position as unable to judge different ways of life passive. It would lead us to accept everything, as it is.
    - the lack of standards makes us unable to dream of a future better than the present
    - Lyotard's counterargument would be that preventing someone from living their chosen way of life would be a crime in his model, and thus atrocities such as Hitler's rise to power and the Holocaust should be halted in it.
  ## Views on literature and art
    Focus: style and expression shifts between modernism and postmodernism.
    -  In postmodernist art: signs of traumatic stress disorder 
    -  manifested in pastiche. Modernism aimed at breaking with the past, but in consequence ends up repeating it. Post-modernism is trying to shake Modernism, and does so by working through past material, the tradition, in order to overcome it.
    -  He says that the fragmentation of the self that we are experiencing is a healthy moment, because we are trying to consider all the incommensurate pieces of our world, but we cannot expect a neat result.
    -  complexity cannot be sidestepped, and art should aim to make us reflect on it.
    -  he later links postmodernist art with the sublime.
    -  He states that art is one of the few instances were what cannot be captured by any existing signifying system can make its existence felt.
    -  to avoid using modernist's categorical reduction and simplification of terms, we must cultivate an appreciation for the sublime, of what resist calculation and understanding.
    -  if postmodernism art can capture this, then we can dream of a future generation which would not condemn differences and allows them to thrive. such a future would do justice to the complexity we live in.
