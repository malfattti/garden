# Lecture 11 Ethnic Criticism and Postcolonialism
## Power
- One of the main focus of Poststructuralism is power
  - Foucault analyzes the relationship between knowledge and power
   - Lyotard analyzes language games and the relationships between master and local narratives
      - strategies of inclusion or submission
      - he questions the possibility of legitimation
    - Derrida targets binary thinking and its normative implications and deconstructs it. Such thinking is not neutral.
      - Binary thinking is questioned also by feminists within psychoanalysis
    - Both deconstruction and psychoanalysis play a role in a field where power and othering are central: imperialism, colonialism and postcolonialism.
      - othering, subjection, inclusion become apparent
## Postcolonialism
 - This movement thus is hard to imagine without the foundations of poststructuralism and psychoanalytic criticism    
 - this theoretical background allows for the conflicts in colonialism to be voiced in terms that both colonized and colonizer will be familiar with
     - however it is important to note that these are Western theories (eurocentric and thus potentially problematic when applied to colonized subjects).
  
## Ethnic identity
- This concept has become important from Nietzsche's, Freud's and Marx
  - however, psychoanalysis still considers that a unified identity is normal and that other instances are pathologies
  - but is a unified identity the norm?
-  on the one hand, the colonized are trying to consolidate an individual and national identity, but poststructuralism attacks both concepts of nation and identity
-  bell hooks says that it is alright to give up your identity, that is, once you have achieved it. but what happens when you have been deprived of an identity.
  
  ## Frantz Fanon
  - His book *The Wretched of the earth* serves as blueprint for the postcolonialist theories to come
  - has a psychoanalysis education and analyzes the colonized in this sense
 - colonialism must legitimize itself to justify the brutal encounters with the colonized, and does so by stating the superiority of the colonizer when compared as the colonized
 - the colonized questions which representation of themselves really applies: their own or that of the colonizer?  (double consciousness / schizophrenia)
      - this question motivates all of postcolonialism to a degree
 - in post-colonial societies, the question is whether nationalism must be a tool to solidify the newly won independence, or if nationalism is the root of all evil
     - Marx: it is the bourgeoisie and its nationalism that has led to colonialism
     - thus is nationalism the norm?
 - however, are national and individual unity the same thing? moreover, unity implies normativity
 - How should the identity of a postcolonial nation be?
   - look back and revive traditions? ("primitive" ones which served to justify colonialism)
     - could that confirm stereotypes?
     - how can a new identity be built?
     - or should a mix between the traditional identity and the one imposed by the colonizers be achieved so that there is no exclusion in this identity? (schizophrenic culture?)
 - who should create this postcolonial identity?
 - Frantz Fanon asks these questions
 - before Start hall, he criticizes the eurocentric idea that Marxism could be applied as is to a poscolonial context
   - in a postcolonial context there is hardly any industrialization as the colonial power uses the colonized land as a purveyor or raw materials 
   - the colonized middle class? according to Marx, the middle class would serve as the force behind the creation of a national identity and political change
     - creation of proletariat

## The middle class and the nation
- In postcolonialism the middle class is unsuited to achieve these tasks 
  - reasons: it has collaborated with the bourgeoisie of the colonizers, it is intellectually lazy and cosmopolitan (they have had contact with the European bourgeoisie, unsuited to create a new nation-state)
  - it cannot contribute with ideas for a national consciousness
  - it is not capable of rationalizing popular action
  - it feels affiliation with the colonizers' middle class and therefore is not "organic"(in Gramsci's terms): it perpetuates the colonizers' hegemony
  - at the same time it is too local (prolongs agricultural production)
  - they are the bourgeoisie but have no entrepreneurial spirit (a characteristic which was responsible for colonialism to begin with, surprisingly) 

- this there is a re-tribalisation fo Africa instead of a revolution
- who will lead if not the bourgeoisie
- While localism is not a suitable strategy,  African unity isn't either
  - Fanon condemns the idea of "glocal" (the local and global combined) which is so prevalent in today's post-national discourse
- Fanon tries to overcome Marx's lack of focus in culture, he instead posits that culture can play an important role in forging a  nation
  - a national state is a combination of a geographic entity (the state) and the idea of the nation, based on culture, that which unites the groups that share the state
- the colonizers have destroyed the national, ethnic or cultural self-consciousness of the colonized
- only once the subjugation has ended, a "new culture" can evolve, which must be liberated from both tradition and the culture of the colonizers
  - a very "modernist" idea
- who brings this culture about? it is rather unclear
- It could be argued that Fanon has a rather romantic notion of nationalism and cosmopolitanism 
- his idea that from the national consciousness an international consciousness will grow cannot in practice be observed in 20th century history.
  - Moreover, Marx states that it is the bourgeoisie which can create the nation and turn it into sth international through trading and markets. But Fanon doe snot consider the biurgeoisie an option
  - Who will do it?
    - the Lumpenproletariat (the "wretched of the earth") would have to achieve this task. But is this sector of the population able to do this?
    - this is rather unlikely:
      - no pioneering spirit shown
      - rather tribal and regional in outlook (just as he accuses the middle class to be), they have not been part of a nation before 
      - the Lumpenproletariat has endured the psychological impact of colonialism
  
  ## Gloria Anzaldúa

  - the experience of colonialism, the split or gap, is painful and pathological and should be overcome
  - Anzaldúa speaks from a different context, and tries to turn the split (hybridity) into something fruitful, without ignoring the suffering it brings about
    - chicanx culture in the border between US and Mexico
  - the countermodel of the suffering (national unity, stability) is inherently patriarchic and nationalistic, these yardsticks should be overcome
    - overcoming of the rules that have defined what is normal, pure, etc.
  - Anzaldúa acknowledges both experiences (the split and stability) and tries to create a dialectic out of the two
  ### The border/la frontera
  - the border between Mexico and the US serves as a metaphor for this (her) experience
  - she argues against identity politics (Fanon) because the concept of identity encloses normativity (stability, authenticity, etc.)
    - we should overcome these concepts
  - She argues for a "global race", which includes and transcends all races (universalizing in its way)
    - should be a "conciencia de mujer" (thus elevating the other aspect of the binary male/female)
    -  a consciousness of the borderland
 - but this synthesis does not yet exist and the experience of the border is both painful and enriching:
   - cultural collision, inner war
 - Anzaldúa's terms to describe the cultural experience of the border are similar to Fanon's description of the psychic state of the colonized
 - However, for Fanon this experience can only be described as pathological and he argues for a "restoration"of the colonized's identity.
 - Anzaldúa instead emphasizes that the state of in-betweenness is both a burden and an opportunity, as an alternative norm which challenges the idea of norm
   -  rigidity means death for the mestiza
   -  Anzaldúa resorts to the distinction that Levis-Strauss makes between a Western mode of rational thinking (or Nietzsche's apollonian style of thinking) which is always based on exclusion (non-contradiction rule) and the cosmological inclusiveness of myth. And myth plays a huge role in Anzaldúa's theory)
- Synthesis which is inclusive (allows for coexistence of contradictions=mythopoetic thinking) and also connects to Cixous and Irigaray in her conception of femininity, in which openness and ability to think differently, ambivalence, is turned into something positive. Am bivalence is needed to create something new, otherwise the stable normative categories remain.

## A new mestiza myth
- Anzaldúa conceptualizes this existence creating this myth which combines the three cultures she lives in
  - a myth which is painful but which also feeds on creativity that challenges unitary paradigms
  - Romantic idea of perpetual becoming as opposed to being
  - for chicanas it is not possible to adhere entirely to their background as it comes with a big dose of machismo
  - the creativity becomes apparent also in her mode of writing which combines different genders and languages

### Coalitions
- she argues against gender or nation boundaries (Fanon)
- she argues against machismo 
- she argues for the allyship of white people (I versus them is what constitutes the problem in the first place)

### Identity and hybridity
- However, the dominated people must first have some kind of identity before this identity can be opened to others 

### The other in oneself
- Anzaldúa and many other post-colonial critics point out that the colonized are not the total other. In fact, colonizers have projected upon the colonized people what is other in themselves and have denied what they can both have in common
- this is used as a legitimation to subjugate the colonized

## Edward Said
- Said also deals with the projection of one's own otherness into the colonized other
- *Orientalism* shows how these projections are created and maintained in a hierarchized discursive framework
- Said is a good example of an organic intellectual, but he is also very public
- His book can be considered one of the first New Historicism sources because in it he analyzes heterogeneous genres and argues that they are all infused with the brute empirical reality
  - just as [[Stephen Greenblatt]] (and also [[Michel Foucault]], as he has influenced both Said and Greenblatt) he states that we deal with semiotic systems but also their embeddedness in a very material cultural context, and that both influence each other 
    - also important are concepts of episteme and hegemony 
  - Said shows how the representation of the Orient evolved excluding how the Orient viewed itself (double consciousness just as in [[Gloria Anzaldúa]] and [[Frantz Fanon]])
    - His analysis starts from the dichotomy East/West
      - the Orient is adjacent to europe, one of its oldest colonies and has helped define Europe as such
      - here we find again the idea that in order to create an own identity, the colonizer projects its otherness onto the colonized
      - another asymmetrical dialectics
  - Orientalism is more than just an idea, it has consolidated itself 
    - in the absence of a corrective (one sided picture)
    - within an imperial framework: the Orient was Orientalized not only because of certain characteristics, but because it could be submitted to.
    - not only does this picture exist, but we have the power to uphold and perpetuate it (knowledge and power) without giving the other the possibility to modify it
  - What is Orientalism?
    - created body of theory and practice (not a fantasy) in which there has been a material investment
    - never far from the idea of Europe (us versus them)
    - and in relationship to what made European culture hegemonic in and outside Europe: European identity as superior (necessary to legitimize colonialism)
    - geographical displacements of repressed desires
    - Orientalism is not only a cultural or historial phenomenon but mainly political. Its analysis is thus also political
    - will to know, typify, include/exclude ([[Michel Foucault]]) what is different, alternative, novel
    - a discourse which is not in direct relationship with power, but which is in exchange with different kinds of power. These powers are at stake, invested in the creation of the Oriental other and they work in different levels (canons, science, politics, history).
   ### The shortcomings of Marxism
   - Criticizes the hierarchy of the base and superstructure: it does not work
   - Like [[Michel Foucault]], he considers that the Orient is not just a conspiracy, but a productive enterprise
     - hegemonic systems like culture are productive, not unilaterally inhibiting
     - relationship between knowledge that is being created (partly for purposes of power) which feeds into structures of power and perpetuates forms of othering, designed to uphold certain forms of power relationship
  ### The absence of the Orient in Orientalism
  - the Orient is absent in Orientalism 
  - The alleged superiority of the Occident allows it to speak on the Orient's  behalf, to create the representations that the Orient cannot create
  - Because Orientalism is a product of the Occident, it entails the danger of creating a "double consciousness", that means, that the Orient begins to perceive itself in the terms created by the West as much as in its own
    - for example, the architecture of new cities such as Dubai responds to the West's stereotypes (tourism).
  - How could this mode be unlearnt? How could we understand other cultures from a non manipulative perspective? What could a reality approached objectively be?
  - is an undistorted view upon another subject or object possible after all we know about semiotic systems after deconstruction and poststructuralism?
  - always be aware that you are part of a system and a discourse that makes you use language in a certain way

## Judith Butler
  - Further radicalizes the assumptions inherent in Lacan and in poststructuralism, specifically in the case of Foucault
  ### Performance 
- This concept has been in use since the 1950s (specially in anthropology and literary theory) 
- But it has gained new significance in feminism and postcolonialism as a new way to conceptualize the dissolution of the center
- Judith Butler is one of the most radical proponents of this concept
  
  ### Feminism and Performance
  - In *Gender Trouble* she criticizes the essentialism in regards to sexual identity present in US feminism
  - influenced by Derrida and Lacan she deconstructs a dichotomy which had been considered an achievement in feminist theory, that is, the sex/gender one
    - sex is natural, biological
    - gender is culturally constructed
  - For Butler, sexual identity cannot be natural because it is mediated by a discourse that is culturally and ideologically defined. Even if we make a distinction between nature and culture, both are discursive constructions. We cannot hope to talk about nature without the mediation of discourse. Nature cannot escape our discursive representations of it.
  - The feminine or masculine are constituted in the repetition of performances that reenact what has been culturally defined as feminine or masculine
  - both sex and gender are no more than citational repetitions (and repetitions cannot be exact, as Derrida has explained), then cultural codes can be changed if we change the performance of sex and gender 
  - what counts as an important part of identity (sexual identity, but maybe other aspects too?) can be rewritten, as it is nothing more than a constructed fiction
  - the male subject (norm) depends on the female other to  define itself, which suggests the illusory quality of the identity
  ### Naturalization
  - the dichotomy nature/culture assumes that nature is unchanging and culture is contingent and malleable
  - but nature is also a discursive product, created within a culture
### How can we get beyond the concept of natural identity? (The sexual identity)
- Butler proposes a scenario where a natural sexed body no longer exists and where identity ceases to be the common ground for feminism
  - As opposed to Spivak, Butler does not believe that essentialism could be a tool for feminism, even for political purposes
- Is there a political shape to women that precedes and prefigures the political elaboration of women's interests and epistemic point of view? 
  - the question of the body
    - the body has been the natural and the mind the means through which the natural should be controlled
    - the bodily drives have usually been connected to sexuality
    - but is the body beyond any kind of inscription? as the sex/gender or nature/culture dichotomies imply
    - when babies are born, people want to know "what" they are? The sexed body has been considered the signified par excellence
    - subsequently our name indicates what sex we have
      - in being called by name we are turned into subjects by those who can name us and thus turned into the symbolic order (Althusser)
  ### Derrida
 - The moment that we are given a name, we are forced into the symbolic order, the aspect of the non-species (not-nameable) has a form of monstrosity, only through naming, taxonomies, we are allowed to become part of the symbolic order
  - Transvaluation: from the monstrosity and nameless into the sublimated domain of values
  - A semblance of order is created with the help of exaggerated binary oppositions and the submission of the subject to them (to one side of them). Anything else would leave us in the untidy space of the nameless
  - is the order natural? is it natural in us to impose order?
### The incest taboo / the homosexual tablespoon

- Both put into question the dichotomy between the natural and cultural:
  - homosexuality is conceived as unnatural and uncivilized, as incest is
  - another example of something deemed "unnatural" to end it at the level of the cultural. However, what is natural is also defined culturally.
  - the naturalized notion of the body is a consequence of the taboos which make the body discrete in virtue of stable boundaries (male/female, heterosexual/homosexual)

### Body boundaries
- the expulsion of other bodies helps consolidate culturally hegemonic identities along the categories of sex/race/sexuality. A border is tenuously maintained for social regulation and control
  - Similar to Foucault's taxonomies of power and categorizing which exclude and include the other for control
- The boundary between the inner and the outer is also important for the body itself
  - the body is doubly other:
    - a blank page to inscribe the signifiers of cultural power
    -  as bodily fluids makes the other other
   - A clear attitude towards things that disturb the inner and outer boundary 
   - all these are denotated/connotated negatively
   - why are these things that come out of the body so negatively connotated
  ### Desire for identity
 - We desire coherence, we idealize it. We do not have a stable identity which is manifested somehow, it is always preproduced, it happens within the frame of certain discursive formations
 - We are only performing our identity and performance always implies the idea of someone else that is not me. There is no inner core or identity that would not be subject to the discursive regimes that are inscribed onto the body 
 - Gender is a fabrication produced to make a discourse of a primary and stable identity true 
 - where does the discourse and the desire for it come from?
 - is the wish for identity something that transcends the binary

### Drag queens
- Three contingent dimensions of significant corporeality:
  - anatomical sex
  - gender identity
  - gender performance
- Gender parodies reveal that the original identity is an imitation without origin 
  - because the origin can only be a performance. Drag is a performance of a performance of a performance. without one sexual identity that would be completely liberated from any kind of cultural or discursive inscriptions
  - this means that there cannot be naturalized gender identities
  - Mimicry in the sense of Irigaray and Bhabha
  - what about the myth of originality? where does it come from?
    - do we need it to make sense of the world?
    - are there alternatives to it?
- How about pregnancy?
  - is reproduction central to the sexing of the body? should it be?
