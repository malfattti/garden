# Introduction: The “Linguistic Turn” – and What Came Before: Marx, Freud, Nietzsche

## What is literary theory?
- It tries to provide parameters for the analysis of literary texts
- Theories are different in regards to:
  - their definition of literature or of what is considered "literary"
  - their definition of the function and status of literature in society, or how the relationship between literature and reality is
  - There is no theory-free approach to literature, everyone approaches literature with some assumptions
- How have traditions and theories defined literature?
  - as fictional
  - as entailing a certain language (poetic language, for example)
  - as mimetic (mirroring reality or nature creatively)
  - as being transgressive, or being able to transcend reality or the status quo because of its fictionality
  - as being didactic (teaching while delighting)
  - as being disinterested (without a purpose, according to Kant)
  - And how has "good literature" being defined?
    - Many different ways, among them: in regards to its beauty, aesthetic unity, acknowledgement in time, canonization, success, emotional impact, originality, morality, critical substance
  - Who has the power to decide these criteria?
    - the public, the numbers that marl the success of a work, history, an elite group of specialists, the impact a work harmless

  ### The Linguistic Turn and Structuralism
  - Before the beginning of the 20th century, literary studies were mostly limited to philology
    - philology analyzed the historical influences of literary works, the etymology of words and the way genres developed
  - Around the beginning of the 20th century, there was an increasing desire to make the study of literature more scientific

- Linguistic turn: a change in emphasis in the discourse of the humanities and social sciences reflecting a recognition (beyond the bounds of linguistics itself) of the importance of language in human meaning-making. The linguistic turn in the humanities came in the 1970s.
- 
### What happened that lead to this linguistic turn?
  - The impact of Saussure's work, and the work of those who came after him, was deep, but the "linguistic turn" was one of four developments in theory and philosophy which had a strong impact on the Enlightenment (and its belief in the power of reason and thus in man's power)
  - Romanticism was already opposed to the rationalist agenda
  - Three thinkers in particular were pivotal to the debilitation of the belief in reason:
    - Marx
    - Nietzsche
    - Freud
  - But before analyzing their impact, it is important to understand how a fourth figure was pivotal to the development of their theories, and that is Kant. Kant argues that:
    - Reason is valid independently of time and space, it is universal
    - If someone acts in such a way that their act may become a universal law, then they have been rational, morally right  
      - morality is based on reason only
    - thus man should never treat someone else as a means, only as an end (to reason, as its embodiment)
    - while truth and what is morally good can be proven objectively (in the case of morals, be proven as necessary: Categorical Imperative ), what is beautiful can only  be intersubjectively verified
    - Beauty is created through a harmonious interaction between imagination and reason (Schiller also believes this)
      - the sublime is an exception, because imagination cannot capture what is infinite or overwhelming, and thus reason has to rescue imagination in this instance
    - the contemplation of beauty is possible because art has no other purpose than its enjoyment
    - The Moral law cannot be represented or perceived directly. Thus, the sublime plays a large role here. Reason intervenes to rescue imagination, to ensure that the Moral law is represented as imagination cannot do it. 
      - This causes on the one hand defeat and on the other victory, of imagination and reason respectively
      - Kant abhors sentimental art, which has been a strong influence on the modern way to view literature until now

### The decay of Enlightenment
- Marx, Freud and Nietzsche attacked the idea of man as the epitome of reason upheld by Enlightenment
- Marx:
  -  questions that human consciousness is the driving force of history (as postulated by Hegel)
  -  questions that history is the process whereby the spirit of the world comes into itself
  -  Instead, Marx thinks that being determines consciousness, and not the other way around
  -  Marx also thinks that man has limited influence on history
- Freud:
  - Thinks furthermore that man is not even in full control of him or herself.
  - They are torn between the mind's unconscious, subconscious and conscious
    - between the pleasure principle of the id and the demands of the moral superego
    - the ego mediates between the two, more or less successfully
 - Nietzsche
    - Questions the concept of truth itself
      - truth is an illusion which man has forgotten is an illusion, a set of metaphors worn by use and which thus are sensed as established and binding
    - Considers that the lives of men are driven by blind desire and will
      - the results are only rationalized a posterior
  ### What is the role of art for each of these thinkers?

  - Marx
    - For Marx and Engels, the base (that is, the means of production and their distribution) determines the superstructure, to where literature belongs.
      - thus, literature can only play a secondary role
    - the role that literature can serve (the idea of literature as serving a purpose contradicts Kant's idea of purposeless art) is to ruthlessly show reality as class struggle
    - it can also help to overcome ideology and the false consciousness it constitutes
    - for Marx and Engels individuals are not agents because history unfolds with the force of law.
      - they only matter as embodiments of ideas and parts of systems
      - this has been corrected by novelists who have successfully exposed the dynamics of capitalism in their works
    - what is the role of the intellectual? 
      - If Marx and Engel's work belongs also to the superstructure, can it change anything? 
      - they consider themselves scientists. Does this solve the problem?
      - the role of intellectuals will be problematic (addressed by Lenin and Gramsci)
      - the bourgeoisie has a demystifying role (Benjamin's loss of the aura) which will lead to a new realism in literature
        - the bourgeoisie gives a cosmopolitan character to production and consumption in every country

- Nietzsche
  - In opposition to Marx's views, art has a central role for Nietzsche.
  - Instead of Marx's rationalistic and scientifically driven agenda (Apollonian), Nietzsche proposes a Dionysian, irrational agenda.
  - This worldview seems primarily represented in art
  - while science strives for truth with the use of words (and this is not possible for Nietzsche), art gets rid of the pretense of truth and sets the Dionysian energies free (this resembles Freud's dichotomy of the conscious and unconscious, with the ego -the tragic- negotiating them)
  - while the Apollonian individuates man and cuts him off the experience of the social and the universal, the Dionysian can reconnect him with these aspects through art
  - The Dionysiac phenomenon is described by Nietzsche:
    -  as revealing the 'playful construction and demolition of the world of individuality" (this resembles deconstruction)
    -  as the play of a child who builds something to destroy it the minute after (this resembles the as of yet uncontrolled drives of a child who has not yet reached the mirror stage according to Lacan)
 - Freud
    -  Literature serves to illustrate Freud's theories, as with Sophocles Oedipus Rex
    -  Dreams follow a poetic logic of:
       -  displacement (metaphor)
       -  condensation (metonymy)
       -  overdetermination (symbolism)
    - Dreams can fly in the face of reason: destroy syllogism (reasoning which arrives at conclusion based on two or more prepositions assumed to be true)
    - The psychoanalyst must decipher them accordingly. 
      - the interpretative activity of psychoanalysis is similar to the work done by the reader
    - Literature has the possibility of revealing that which has been repressed in the author or in society and history (the uncanny)
    - because of the fictive character of literature, it has the bypass the reality principle
### Dichotomies
- Marx, Nietzsche and Freud all share their preoccupation for deep dichotomies present in human life which undermine an assumed unity and predominance of reason - and man as its embodiment
- Marx's notion of estrangement and the forceful suppression of the worker's needs in the context of the class struggle is similar to Freud's concept of the sublimation of the drives by the superego and the dialectics of the Dionysian and the Apollonian in Nietzsche
-  The three assume that there is a split between what is real:
   -  in Marx, the economic history
   -  in Freud, the reality principle or super ego
   - in the Apollonian, the drive to explain and control the world 
 - and what is outside of the real 
   - ideology and false consciousness in Marx
   - the drives in Freud 
   - the dissolution of the self in Nietzsche
-  These dichotomies are important for our lecture
