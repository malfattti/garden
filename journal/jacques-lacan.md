# Jacques Lacan

## Starting points
- [[Sigmund Freud]], whom he criticizes and radicalizes with the tools of [[structuralism]]. Freud presupposes that the relationship between desires and inhibitions helps the emergence of a stable ego, so he presupposes a human stable subjectivity. lacan does not believe that. He believes that there is a very limited sense of individual subjectivity. There is a complexity which each of us inhabits a little differently.
- [[Roman Jakobson]]'s concepts of syntagmatic and paradigmatic relationships in language. According to Jakobson, poetic language uses the principle of equivalence not only at the paradigmatic level (choices between words with the same function - vertical - diachrony) but at the syntagmatic level (how words are put together in a sentence - horizontal - synchrony). The way the words relate with each other in a verse or group of verses (through rhyme, alliteration, etc.) matters as much as the meaning of the original choice of words (plain meaning). How words are put together separates poetic from normal language.
- [[Brooks]] concept of metonymy: a narrative is a sequences of detour which sustain desire resulting in a proper end ([[Freud]]'s idea of the organism's desire to die in its own way can be linked to this).
- [[Jakobson]]'s definition of metaphor: a binding of signs, an effect of unity between signs.
- attacks marxism and positive tradition. Language does not express thought, but constitutes thought itself.
## ¿Por qué es importante Lacan para la teoría literaria?
- Desde finales del s. XIX, la literatura moderna y el psicoanálisis se deben mucho el uno al otro.
- En muchos conceptos del psicoanálisis se ve esta deuda: "complejo de Edipo", masoquismo, sadismo. Y los conceptos más fundamentales del psicoanálisis se organizan con una lógica que tiene que ver con la ficción.
- Quizás en el sentido inverso me nos, pero muchos procedimientos de la literatura moderna tienen que ver con el psicoanálisis (poesía y psicoanálisis pero también se ve en selecciones de textos en revistas de poesía) 
## Greatest contributions to psychoanalysis

- 4 Theses:
  - The "I" develops through the mirror stage.
  - The unconscious is structured like a language
  - The subject desires an object created through a perpetual lack, it is forever delayed and never fulfilled.
  - The human psyche is structured along the triad of the imaginary, the symbolic and the real.
## The mirror stage
- When the child is between 6 and 18 months old (anal phase), it notices in the mirror that it is a whole subject, although it perceives itself to be a disconnected ensemble of parts (a baby lacks organization and has no uprightness).
- [[Paul Fry]] here adds that the child then sees itself as the object of their mother's desire.
- Results:
  - narcissistic identification of the the ego or "Grössen-ich", but this whole and coordinated self has not yet been attained (the child is still uncoordinated and dependent)) and never will be. One is never completely independent of their environment.
  - There is thus a discrepancy between the identification with an imaginary picture (the imaginary) and the experience of incoordination and fragmentation.
  - allows the child to see itself the way other people may see it. (mother: as an object of desire).
  -   The former symbiotic relationship to a nurturing environment is severed and there is a desire to return to it.
      -   the baby falls into language. 
      -   the baby realizes that it does not have its own name but the name of the father. But it does not have his phallus.
      -  competition and unattainability for child. Envy of the father.
      -  
- The outside constitutes the symbolic order:
 
  - The symbolic order has a set of rules, one of them being that one cannot return to the pre-symbolic stage. 
    - has several other rules: everything from language to the economy of exchange and other social norms.
  - It designs the order that will control the desires and drives of child once it grows up.
  - turning away from the mother leads to socialization at a cost, which is a forever unfulfilled desire.
  - it will also impede the achievement of the imaginary "I" (restriction of omnipotence fantasies)
  - instead the desire for the mother is replaced with other desires.
- The real:
  - What remains when the drives cannot be sublimated
  - The unconscious cannot be made present, if it could be made present then it would be conscious (critic of Freud)
  - Constitutes horror or trauma of disconnection from mother (1st object of desire) but also the residues remaining from unsuccessful operations of sublimations of drives. 
  - In contrast with jouissance, the real is something rather negative, remains in the dark, exerts influence through traces but ultimately inaccessible.
  
## The unconscious is structured like a language 
  
- The Real or unconscious is not representable (unrepresentable?) because the human psyche works like a language.
- Freud says that dreams are an attempt to make the conscious readable but in a metaphorically or metonimically (figural moments: condensation and displacement) distorted way.
- To this, Lacan says that to transfer the real into the symbolic is practically impossible:
  - They relate as the signified to the signifier.
  - The bar between them is the human psyche which tries to put into signifiers a signified which it cannot reach. We never have direct access to the unconscious. The signified cannot be put one to one with a signifier.
  - The Real is not a transcendental signified, it cannot be transferred into the realm of signification. 
  - There are signifiers that refer to a signified but there is no logical or clear relationship between the two.

## Metonymy and metaphor in Lacan
  - Metonymy: perpetual deferral of bringing into conscious the object of desire, as well as the imposibility of realizing a desire for a certain kind of other. Thus there is a "plot-sutaining detour" (Brooks).
  - Metaphor: the quilting of the metonymy chain that holds together a sequence of signs. A substitution instead of displacement of signs. happens every once in a while and it is the only possible manifestation of the symptom.
  - Lacan believes that we can never get what we desire, but we can get what we need.
