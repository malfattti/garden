## Starting points
- Lacan
- role of language in patriarchic status quo
- can we find a language that escapes the phalogocentrism that characterizes Western metaphysical discourse (Derrida)
- If we can only perceive the world through language, then it will play a significant role in changing it
  - holds especially true for the language of philosophy
