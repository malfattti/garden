- His work is linked to New Historicism
  - does justice to contingency
  - reticence to define this school of criticism, but his article [[The circulation of social energy]] is the closest attempt at such definition
  - is particularly relevant for Early Modern societies and cultures because of particularities of repressive modes and modes of resistance
  - Any explanatory model cannot be unitary
    - a text might mirror dominant codes as well as resist them
  - Opposes to Old Historicism, which believed that facts will speak for themselves so long as the investigator registers and enumerates them
  - opposes materialist definition of power as capable of being traced back to individual o corporate ideologies
    - a text can reflect but also manufacture cultural codes (text as action)
    - attention to least formal witness (anecdotes, diaries, etc.)

## Starting points
- [[Jean-François Lyotard]]'s postmodern theory
- [[Fredric Jameson]]'s Marxist theory
- Clifford Geertz' social anthropology
- Foucault's antu-humanism
  
  ## The circulation of social energy (opening chapter from [[Shakespearean Negotiations]])
  - Starting point: desire to speak with the dead: re-create a conversation with them
  - the dead leave textual traces behind them which are heard in the voices of the living
  - what happens with fiction? 
    - there was never in them a living person to begin with, but simulation
    - however lovers of literature find more intensity in these simulations than in other textual traces left behind by dead people
    - literature is aware of its will to represent a life that is absent in them, and are therefore more adept to compensate for the vanishing of the life that has created them
    - his focus is on Shakespeare
      - total artist: training, resourcefulness and talent
      - in totalizing society: organized network of elements where the ruling elite has a privileged position. Dreams of access to power.
      - confrontation between total artist and totalizing society results in powerful works of art
