# Lecture 12 Postcolonialism II and Performance

## Homi Bhabha
- Starts from Fanon, Derrida, Foucault and Lacan to become ne of the most prominent thinkers of postcolonialism

### Hybridity and ambivalence
- Uses Derrida and Foucault (and radicalizes their theories) to deconstruct the unilateralism of the dichotomy of colonized/colonizer while allocating resources of power on the side of the colonized
- Uses two concepts to do so:
  - Hybridity
    - the identities of colonizer and colonized are not two different and impermeable ones
    - the colonizer assumes their identity to be normal and unified, while the colonized has an "other" identity
    - the concept of identity itself is part of the colonizers' agenda (is in itself defined by the colonizers and withheld from the colonized, as in [[Frantz Fanon]])
    - the other is not just an other, but one that puts the concept of identity into question
    - from this results hybridity, which is neither of those selves
    - restoring the identity of the colonized is not the point, but questioning the concept of identity as such (unified, stable)
    - hybridity arises because the presence of colonial power is never assumed, it can only be felt by its belated effects. The center of colonial power is always somewhere else
    -  These effects are replacements of dislocations because the center of power is replaced and dislocated
    -  Hybridity evolves within the margins and fissures of those dislocations and opens the play within the structure
    -  the colonial presence is always ambivalent, split between its appearence and its articulation as repetition and difference
- Rules of recognition: 
  - colonial power does not come with its own nationalistic discourse only, but with a set of rules which allow for the colonized subject to decipher said discourse
  - they serve as a users' manual but the fact that you need them constitutes already an admission that the discourse can be misread, and that another decipherment could take place instead
  - Power carries within itself the roots of its own subversion, especially when it is dislocated and distorted ([[Michel Foucault]])
  - The colonizer assumes a unified subject or identity that is allegedly universal
  - What is universal is always being defined from a local point of view, which implies that there are other points of view from which the universal could be defined
    - thus universalism cannot be achieved because it is always being defined from a local point of view
  - at the same time colonial authority undermines the idea of a universal subject when acknowledging the racial and cultural difference and with the hierarchization of the colonial regime 
  - Hybridity: a potential source of resistance
    - Can hybridity be used by the colonized, not just to deconstruct the unstable identity of the colonizer, but to to restore some  his or her agency? 
    - Inherent contradiction:
      - the superiority of the colonizer is defined through a concept of a universal identity that is withheld from the colonized 
      - but the assumption of this difference throws back light to the alleged universalist assumption of such an identity. because there are and must be different forms of identity
      - this paradox opens up the split where hybridity is located
    - This form of splitness has an empowering aspect for Bhabha
    - Which change of perspective occurs with hybridity? How can it be politically used as a form of resistance?
    - If a new culture is to be devised in a postcolonial context, can it be done without the taxonomies imposed on them?
      - The Bible was one of the most dangerous books because it put into question the caste system that existen in India
    - Culture is never pure or homogeneous for neither colonized nor colonizer, is an effect of a conflict
    - The notion of two cultures (one of the colonized, one of the colonizer) is replaced by the idea of a new form of culture, hybrid as compared to both the colonizer and the former colonized's culture 
    - and what does this mean for the colonizer's aculture
    -  Bhabha opposes Fanon since he wants to leave nationalism and national cultures behind
    -  Mimicry: the realization that you cannot escape the discourse of the colonizer or the discourse of a national or regional culture. However, to use its language as a camouflage, to operate with, while trying to define a new concept of what counts as culture if culture is never stable or unchangeable, but always a result of a perpetual process of negotiation, change.

## Gayatri Spivak
- Feminist, Marxist, post-structuralist, psychoanalytic critic
- Like Bhabha, she takes her homeland of India as a starting point of her analysis
- Can the subaltern speak? How? What language is at its disposal? Should someone else speak for them? (Marx states that they cannot)
  ### The organic intellectual
  - Like Derrida, she choses a politics of the open end, which ensure that no other opinion is excluded
  - She rejects a romanticization of the other as that would put another mask over the subaltern
### The Subaltern
- Has an ambivalent position towards power, subordinate to it but never falling entirely pray to the hegemonic practices of those in power
- The subaltern therefore cannot speak for themselves, they have neither power nor vocabulary
- If someone else, like an organic intellectual, should embark themselves upon this task, they should be aware of their own position in another context and the limitations and blind spots that being in such position entails
-  Like Said, Spivak assumes that an epistemic violence is being inflicted, and wonder whether the other can speak, or if another voice can speak for them without making them in consequence fall victim to the violence of Western Orientalism
   -  when representing someone else, there is always the danger that a gap or differance will come in, that works or is subject to distortion, and thus that what is being represented is not represented but distorted
### The elite and the organic intellectual
- Like Fanon, Spivak criticizes the bourgeoisie elitism that connects both the bourgeoisie of the colonized and colonizer. The making of an Indian nation is presented as the merits of these elite groups, and the people who cannot speak and are not being represented in these versions of history
- Against this monolithic elite, the colonized subaltern is heterogeneous (or hybrid according to Bhabha). Can it be represented?
- The feminine is moreover doubly subaltern
### Who speaks?
- The fact that an other is included in academic work to be deciphered does not mean that the subaltern is in fact speaking. And if it does speak, what for?
  ### Strategic essentialism
 - This is the essentialism that at times must be adopted in political action for it to be effective. As a feminist, she will not only speak for herself, but for women as a group.
 - One should however be aware of them

## Judith Butler
  - Further radicalizes the assumptions inherent in Lacan and in poststructuralism, specifically in the case of Foucault
  ### Performance 
- This concept has been in use since the 1950s (specially in anthropology and literary theory) 
- But it has gained new significance in feminism and postcolonialism as a new way to conceptualize the dissolution of the center
- Judith Butler is one of the most radical proponents of this concept
  
  ### Feminism and Performance
  - In *Gender Trouble* she criticizes the essentialism in regards to sexual identity present in US feminism
  - influenced by Derrida and Lacan she deconstructs a dichotomy which had been considered an achievement in feminist theory, that is, the sex/gender one
    - sex is natural, biological
    - gender is culturally constructed
  - For Butler, sexual identity cannot be natural because it is mediated by a discourse that is culturally and ideologically defined. Even if we make a distinction between nature and culture, both are discursive constructions. We cannot hope to talk about nature without the mediation of discourse. Nature cannot escape our discursive representations of it.
  - The feminine or masculine are constituted in the repetition of performances that reenact what has been culturally defined as feminine or masculine
  - both sex and gender are no more than citational repetitions (and repetitions cannot be exact, as Derrida has explained), then cultural codes can be changed if we change the performance of sex and gender 
  - what counts as an important part of identity (sexual identity, but maybe other aspects too?) can be rewritten, as it is nothing more than a constructed fiction
  - the male subject (norm) depends on the female other to  define itself, which suggests the illusory quality of the identity
  ### Naturalization
  - the dichotomy nature/culture assumes that nature is unchanging and culture is contingent and malleable
  - but nature is also a discursive product, created within a culture
### How can we get beyond the concept of natural identity? (The sexual identity)
- Butler proposes a scenario where a natural sexed body no longer exists and where identity ceases to be the common ground for feminism
  - As opposed to Spivak, Butler does not believe that essentialism could be a tool for feminism, even for political purposes
- Is there a political shape to women that precedes and prefigures the political elaboration of women's interests and epistemic point of view? 
  - the question of the body
    - the body has been the natural and the mind the means through which the natural should be controlled
    - the bodily drives have usually been connected to sexuality
    - but is the body beyond any kind of inscription? as the sex/gender or nature/culture dichotomies imply
    - when babies are born, people want to know "what" they are? The sexed body has been considered the signified par excellence
    - subsequently our name indicates what sex we have
      - in being called by name we are turned into subjects by those who can name us and thus turned into the symbolic order (Althusser)
  ### Derrida
 - The moment that we are given a name, we are forced into the symbolic order, the aspect of the non-species (not-nameable) has a form of monstrosity, only through naming, taxonomies, we are allowed to become part of the symbolic order
  - Transvaluation: from the monstrosity and nameless into the sublimated domain of values
  - A semblance of order is created with the help of exaggerated binary oppositions and the submission of the subject to them (to one side of them). Anything else would leave us in the untidy space of the nameless
  - is the order natural? is it natural in us to impose order?
### The incest taboo / the homosexual tablespoon

- Both put into question the dichotomy between the natural and cultural:
  - homosexuality is conceived as unnatural and uncivilized, as incest is
  - another example of something deemed "unnatural" to end it at the level of the cultural. However, what is natural is also defined culturally.
  - the naturalized notion of the body is a consequence of the taboos which make the body discrete in virtue of stable boundaries (male/female, heterosexual/homosexual)

### Body boundaries
- the expulsion of other bodies helps consolidate culturally hegemonic identities along the categories of sex/race/sexuality. A border is tenuously maintained for social regulation and control
  - Similar to Foucault's taxonomies of power and categorizing which exclude and include the other for control
- The boundary between the inner and the outer is also important for the body itself
  - the body is doubly other:
    - a blank page to inscribe the signifiers of cultural power
    -  as bodily fluids makes the other other
   - A clear attitude towards things that disturb the inner and outer boundary 
   - all these are denotated/connotated negatively
   - why are these things that come out of the body so negatively connotated
  ### Desire for identity
 - We desire coherence, we idealize it. We do not have a stable identity which is manifested somehow, it is always preproduced, it happens within the frame of certain discursive formations
 - We are only performing our identity and performance always implies the idea of someone else that is not me. There is no inner core or identity that would not be subject to the discursive regimes that are inscribed onto the body 
 - Gender is a fabrication produced to make a discourse of a primary and stable identity true 
 - where does the discourse and the desire for it come from?
 - is the wish for identity something that transcends the binary

### Drag queens
- Three contingent dimensions of significant corporeality:
  - anatomical sex
  - gender identity
  - gender performance
- Gender parodies reveal that the original identity is an imitation without origin 
  - because the origin can only be a performance. Drag is a performance of a performance of a performance. without one sexual identity that would be completely liberated from any kind of cultural or discursive inscriptions
  - this means that there cannot be naturalized gender identities
  - Mimicry in the sense of Irigaray and Bhabha
  - what about the myth of originality? where does it come from?
    - do we need it to make sense of the world?
    - are there alternatives to it?
- How about pregnancy?
  - is reproduction central to the sexing of the body? should it be?
